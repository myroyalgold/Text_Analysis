# Text_Analysis
Using Python commands to perform text analysis.

# What is text analysis?
Text analysis, also known as text mining or text analytics, refers to the process of extracting meaningful information and insights from textual data.

# Probelm Statement
Tasked with analyzing customer feedback for a product using a large dataset of customer reviews, which are provided as strings. The objective is to extract valuable insights from these reviews by employing three specific analysis techniques. The goal is to identify key themes, sentiments, and actionable recommendations that can enhance product performance and customer satisfaction.

# Objectives
- Use Python commands to perform text analysis.
- Convert the text to lowercase and then find and count the frequency of all unique words, as well as a specified word.

# Data Types Used
- List
- String
- Classes and Object

# Tasks:
## Task 1. String in lowercase:
Pre-process the customer feedback by converting all the text to lowercase. This step helps standardize the text. Lower casing the text allows you to focus on the content rather than the specific letter casing.

## Task 2. Frequency of all words in a given string:
After converting the text to lowercase, determine the frequency of each word in the customer feedback. This information will help you identify which words are used more frequently, indicating the key aspects or topics that customers are mentioning in their reviews. By analyzing the word frequencies, you can gain insights into the most common issues raised by customers.

## Task 3. Frequency of a specific word:
In addition to analyzing the overall word frequencies, track the frequency of a particular word that is relevant to your analysis. For example, you might be interested in monitoring how often the word "reliable" appears in customer reviews to gauge customer sentiment about the product's reliability. By focusing on the frequency of a specific word, you can gain a deeper understanding of customer opinions or preferences related to that particular aspect.

# Solution:
## Part A
- Step 1: Define a string
- Step 2: Define the class and its attributes
- Step 3: Implement a code to format the text in lowercase
- Step 4: Implement a code to count the frequency of all unique words
- Step 5: Implement a code to count the frequency of a specific word

## Part B
- Step 1: Create an instance of TextAnalyzer class
- Step 2: Call the function that converts the data into lowercase
- Step 3: Call the function that counts the frequency of all unique words from the dataÂ¶
- Step 4: Call the function that counts the frequency of a specific word
